the T10 target (at the beginning of the experiment is hit by a primary proton beam from SPS accelerator at 400 GeV (momentum): 400 mm long 2mm diameter beryllium 

the outgoing beam from the proton beam with the stationary T10 target is the secondary hadron beam K12 at 75 GeV (momentum)

75% of kaons do not decay before hitting the beam dump (lead surrounded by concrete to absorb the beam at the very end) 

in order to keep probability > 99% requires:
time interval (or time resolution) = 100 - 150 ps 
between incoming kaon and outgoing charge particles

using decay-in-flight technique:
booster the products of the decay to high velocities
thus high momenta, relativistic particles
and observe they as they travel downstream 

CEDAR = differential cherenkov counter with achromatic ring focusing (counts the number of cherekov radiation from charged particles moving v>c in the gas medium

NA62 configs:
CEDAR gas volume: 0.94 m^3 
N2 gas at room temp and at 1.75 bar
H2 gas at 3.9 bar 
originally CEDAR was filled with N2 gas 
these parameters are selected to optimize the time resolution

two apparatuses of interest: CEDAR and KTAG
kaons are identified by KTAG (detector with 8 photodetectors)
kaons discriminated from pions and protons via CEDAR (counter) 

NA62 configs:
CEDAR gas volume: 0.94 m^3 
N2 gas at room temp and at 1.75 bar
H2 gas at 3.9 bar 
originally CEDAR was filled with N2 gas 
these parameters are selected to optimize the time resolution  
gas kept at room temp
pressure: ~0 to 5 bar 
angular beam divergence < 100 mu-rad in each plane 

using H2 gas in lieu of N2 gas decreases the beam emmittance (xsi_0 or beam width) by ~9% in each plane 

PM = photomultiplier 

Regarding CEDAR and KTAG:
beam focused (after traversing through CEDAR) into 8 exit windows and focused onto 8 spherical mirrors which reflect radially out into 8 sectors (aka light boxes) in insulated, cooled, faraday enclosed N2 gas
each light box is a wave guide with 64 conical sections. Inside each cone is 48 PM, but 16 peripheral cones in each sector are not used.

from the 2015 experiment using N2 gas: 
clear separation of +pion, proton, and +kaon peaks if confidence of signals >= 5 sectors
at 1.75 bar is optimized for +k ID with <num of PM signals / +k> = 20  
KTAG time resolution for individual PM signals = |hit time in PM - <time of all signals produced>|
rms time resoltuion = 300 ps
time resolution (assuming <num of Pm signals / +k> = 20) = 70 ps 
KTAG efficiency > 98%
KTAG misidentification ~ 10E-4

Cerenkov angle (given a beam momentum and pressure) is a function of mass of particle and wavelengthof cerenkov radiation 

West CEDAR currently using H2 gas
if used N2 gas in lieu at room temp willreduce beam scattering and minimize cerenkov dispersion, such that light from -k or +k (excluding neutral k) will pass through but pi and h cerenkov light will not

ring shaped diaphram radius = 100 mmdiaphram ~ slit 

causes of broadening (widening) of the light spot at the diaphram:
1. optical aberrations
2. chromatic dispersion
3. scattering of the beam (N-fold)
4.inhomogenous (not same for all points)) refraction index of gas due to temp grad
5. beam divergence 
6. noise and "halo" particles contributing to scintillation light production 

west CEDAR is represented by CEDAR 

CEDAR detector needs:
1. time resolution = 100 ps
2. kaon tagging efficiency >= 95%
BUT the PMs are not fast enough, thus need KTAG (photomultipliers). 

CEDAR to see full proton peak need pressure = 5 bar 

intrinsic rate due to kaons of the beam ~ 50 Mhz 
~100 photos avg per kaon at the window (already accounting for losses)  

light from kaons passes through diaphram and quartz window and produce lights spots via photodetectors. 8 sectors

100 photons per kaon distributed among the 8 sectors

counter = counts the number of events of something
detector = identifies or finds the charateristics of something 
KTAG = detector
CEDAR = counter 

KTAG avg rate of identifying charge kaons: 50 - 750 MHz 

NA62 requirements:
1. time resolution >= 100 ps
2. effifiency > 95% 
3. contamination of kaon sample < 10E-4 

KTAG was based off of CEDAR 

KTAG detector identifies charge kaons and rejects other particles
CEDAR counter simply discriminates between protons, pions, and kaons of the unseparated beam  

because CEDAR's PMs and electronics were not sufficient for the beam (to meet requirements) needed new electronics and PMs, thus KTAG 

CEDAR long tube length ~ 7 m 
currenlty using N2 gas 

CEDAR has a spherical mirror, chromatic corrector, lenses, and diaphram (ring-like slit) and ultimately delivers the cerenkov rad to 8 quartz exit windows which then redirect the light to spherical mirrors and to 256 PMs 

number of detectable photo-e / beam particle determines:
1. efficiency
2. time resoltuion
3. somewhat contamination of pi in k sample
4. single channel hit rate (constrains read-out)

need individual channels < 5 Mhz avg 
avg product rate of photo-e < 5 MHz / PM for both gases 

using H2 gas means PMs must have higher quantum efficiency 

cherenkov rad from CEDAR that passed through the quartz windows is reflected by spherical mirror and onto a light guide

light guide = inner wall of light box (~ faraday cage containing electronics and PMs) 



	from "CERN-82-13"



CEDAR can flag protons of 12 GeV and separate kaons from pions up to 150 GeV 

I assume the cherenkov angle is the angle between the beam and the emitted charge particles of the beam

light spot = final image made at the end of CEDAR 
after cherenkov light relfects of a spherical mirror
gets corrected and light (ideally from kaons) passes
through a ring-shaped diaphram/slit and reaches a PM 
(technically the original PMs are replaced by
KTAG system which conssits of PMs), and the light is 
counted. 
Originally there were 8 PMs per window  

effects broadening (widening) the light spot:
1. optical abberations 
	astigmatism (light scattered instead of focused)
	coma aberrations (imperfect lenses)
	spherical aberrations (light not reflected all at one point thus unfocused) 
2. chromatic dispersion 
	separation of light into different wavelengths due to the frequency
	dependence of the refractive index of a medium and thus the phase velocity
	(phase velocity can be > c but group velocity cannot)
	(phase velocity = w / k, group velocity = delta w / delta k) 
	chromatic dispersion depends on phase velocity 
	At high energy chromatic dispersion is proprotional to theta 
3. multiple scattering 
	center of light ring depends on direction of particle trajectory 
	if direction changes in the gas, get non-concentric circles and broadening
	Depends on type of gas used 
4. inhomogeneity of refractive index 
	changes width of light rings 
	No pressure grad in CEDAR but 
	there is a temp grad after long time 
6. photomultiplier noise 
	light produced by halo particles that hit optics 
	scintillation light produced by beam particles in gas
	halo particles = particles from the halo beam
	primary beam = proton beam prior to colliding with fixed 
	target
	secondary beam = charge hadronic beam after 
	primary beam hits fixed target
	tertiary beam = halo beams, shower of particles from 
	interacting with equipment 
	scintillation light = produced in transparent material 
	when certain 
	particle traverses through. Scintillation is a form 
	of lumiescence (wiki)
	luminescence = spotaneous emission of light by subtance 
	NOT resulting from heat (opposite of incandescence) 
	but rather from chem reactions, subatomic motion
	 or crystal stress 

number of cherenkov light emitted depends on:
	1. length of radiator (i.e. the gas)
	2. cherenkov angle 
	3. range of wavelengths accepted by system  

maximum pressure for gas in CEDAR = 15 bar 

parameters chosen wisely to otpimize resolution:
theta in "contradiction" with light output requirement
reduced spectral range
limited length of radiator
chose gas to mimize chroamtic dispersion and multiple scattering

goal: discard signal produced by unwanted particles (rings of diff diameter)
via: light through circular diaphram and focus onto 8 PMs
